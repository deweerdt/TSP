TODO list:

========
 COMMON
========
- complete the TODO list ( !!! ;)  )					@All
- Promote the product							@All
- Write a programer's Guide, and/or architecture from  code		@Seb
- Update specification versus code					@?
- Enhance RPC commandibilty with CORBA & XML				@?
- Handle accurate bufferisation on provider & consumer sides		@?
  QoS on troughput  
  (be able to know the size of the requested datan and refuse it if too big)
- Allow to read/write on one TSP symbol (protocol V2 opaque cmd)	@?
- Compile under VxWorks							@Jerome
- Use TSP on UDP, secure sockets, SHM, ... instead of just TCP/IP	@?
- Add an asynchronous Mode						@Bob
- Add tsp_config.h for configuring/document FIFO sizes			@?

==========
 PROVIDER
==========
- Replace all the 'typedef void*' object encapsulation trick by		@Caribou
  a 'typedef struct TSP_mystruct_t TSP_mystruct_t' that hides
  the internal struct too, but does not hide it when we try
  to debug (the 'void*' stuff to hide the object was not a good
  idea at all)
- The datapool should store the data in a RAW format. The conversion	@?
  to other formats (RAW, STRING, ARRAY, INT, DOUBLE, ...) 
  should be done when sending
  the data to a consumer (given that the conversion depends on what
  were the data formats asked by the consumer)
- Allow Provider to add symbols on the fly or on request		@?
- Allow to select/tune thread priorityi + thread state			@Erk
- Implement PUSH philosphy for adding sample values in provider		@Duf
- Add a naming service (something like "rpc://host.out.in:StubServer)	@?
- Correct bug on FIFO Full => exit

==========
 CONSUMER
==========
- The consumer API should be able to choose the endianity of		@?
  the transmited data : its endianity, or the provider's endianity
  (the latest should be the default)
- The consumer API shoud have a get_last_error function to get details
  when a function fails ( mainly for the TSP_consumer_get_sample function
  that has plenty of reasons to fail )
- Implement properly the callback function used to read the samples
  (the error code must be added)
- Give XDR API for Client (to build lowlevel recording)
- res recorder with indianity

==========
 GDISP+		@Euskady
==========
- look in src/gdisp+/TODO
- Find a real sexy name for that STUF

==========
 JTSP		@sgalles
==========
- Add a Ant task to create API Javadoc
- Add a Ant task to create the tar.gz distribution files (both for bundled)
and non bundled jar)
- Refactor exceptions (use JDK 1.4 base Exceptions)
- Integrate TspURL class
- Refactor TspURL using regexp 
- Allow Jsynoptic to use an URL
- Use Doug Lea util.concurrent package as RingBuf for JTSP
- Try to improve RPC error messages in TspRpcException
- Get ride of JAVA Makefiles (et remove JAVA ref in configure)
