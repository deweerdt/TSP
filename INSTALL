Compilation procedure
========================

Note : 
- Autoconf/Automake is not used yet...     :(
- The shell that must be used is tcsh...   :(
As soon as possible Autoconf/Automake and bash 
will be used.

Now to compil :

% gzip -cd tsp.tar.gz | tar xvf -  # unpack the sources
% cd tsp                           # change to the toplevel directory
% ./configure                      # run the fake `configure' script

The configure script will tell you what to do then.
