- handle lost synchro (generates a BB provider overrun)
- make the bb provider generates its own timestamp
  as provided symbol
- make the bb_provider ignore (not provided to TSP consumer)
  bb symbols whose type
  is not easily handled by TSP through a bb_type -> double conversion.
- add a standalone (not synchronized) mode where the shadow
  blackboard update is made by the provider itself without
  waiting for BB synchro 
- add full-synchronized mode with TSP consumer writer
