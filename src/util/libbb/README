 Overview
 ========

Current directory implement a 
BlackBoard idiom implemenation.

The idea of the blackboard is a publish/subscribe paradigm.
The blackboard idiom makes it very easy to implement
a TSP enabled simulator using the tsp_bb_provider.

If you want to try you may run

bb_simu -s (the faked simulator using a BlackBoard)

then run

bb_tsp_provider

then launch any tsp consumer


 In-kernel black board 
 =====================

The build produces a bb.ko module, insmod it:
	# insmod bb.ko
The dmesg, will show the following messages:
	# dmesg
	New bb device created, major: 254, minor: 0
	New bb device created, major: 254, minor: 1
	Kernel black board loaded.
	See http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/tsp for details.

This means that two sample black boards were just created (pass run_test=0
to insmod if you want to avoid it). To access them, you need to create
the associated character devices (with the corresponding major and
minor numbers):
	# mknod /dev/bbk0 c 254 0


The black board can now be reached by:
	# bb_tools bb_dump /dev/bbk0

	  @start blackboard    = 0xb7f6f000
