1) At main / kernel level.

  - many things are hardcoded (plot frequency = 10 Hz).
       make them be dynamically modified via GUI.
  - save / load symbol and graphic configuration (XML)
  - HTML help on line with the use of GtkHTML widget.
       Before that, the GtkHTML widget should be modified
       in order to avoid linking with Gnome and Bonobo libraries.
  - graphic plots may become independant dynamic modules.
  - animation of TSP logo.

2) At sampling level.

  - the GTK step timer period is the minimum period of all plots.
    it should be the PGCD of all plot periods.


3) At 2D plot level.

  - tolerance band for each of Y symbols.
  - finalize the link between sampling threads and graphic plots in
    case of multi-providers.


4) At page management level.

  - dynamically extend a graphic plot upward, downward, to the left,
    to the right.
  - implement not square graphic pages (L x C with L != C )


5) At databook level.

  - change the way a symbol is graphically affected to a provider.
      replace the color by a pixmap representing the provider.
  - the databook can only be resized vertically.


6) At TEXT plot level.

  - change symbol color if its value exceeds extrema.
