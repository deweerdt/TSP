- Refactor TspURL using regexp. Some URL pattern are missing
- Create a TspUserException with an enum for GUI traitement of

and non bundled jar)
- Update Javadoc for exceptions
- Use Doug Lea util.concurrent package as RingBuf for JTSP
(if it matches what we want to do)
- Try to improve RPC error messages in TspRpcException
- Get ride of JAVA Makefiles (et remove JAVA ref in configure)
- Remove dependencies on rpc package from consumer
- Remove package cycles
- Why do we return a SessionId as an Integer ? shouldn't it be an object ?
- Removed remaining JAVA makefiles
- Reorganize packages of consumers : the directory tree does not match the
package structure ('tsp' should the root)
