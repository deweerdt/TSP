<p><b>README</b>

<p>The whole release shebang is summarized in our
<a href="changelog.remotetea.html">Change Log</a>.

<p>As always, the most current information about the Remote Tea Java
Library, as well as updates, can be found on the web
at the <a href="http://acplt.org/ks/remotetea.html">Remote Tea ONC/RPC Home Page</a>.

<p>The Remote Tea Java Library is licensed under the terms of the
<a href="Copying.lib">GNU Library General Public License</a> (LGPL).

<p>Rationale:
while the LGPL does not restrict the use of my packages even in
commercial applications, I am ensuring this way that modifications to
the source code <b>must</b> be given back to the comunity. If you use
my packages in commercial applications, you must either include the
source code of the Remote Tea ONC/RPC Java Library or provide the source code to
your customers on request. The details can be found in the
<a href="Copying.lib">LGPL terms</a>.

<p>The directory structure is as follows:
<ul>
<li><code>doc/</code>: <a href="../doc/index.html">Remote Tea ONC/RPC online
documentation</a>

&nbsp;<p><li><code>src/</code>: source code of the Remote Tea ONC/RPC Java Library.
<ul>
<li><code>src/org/acplt/oncrpc</code> contains the source code of the
various packages.
<li><code>src/org/acplt/oncrpc/apps</code> contains applications, in this
case only the jrpcgen rpc protocol compiler in the <code>jrpcgen/</code>
subdirectory.
<li><code>src/tests</code> contains test code.
<li><code>src/tests/org/acplt/oncrpc/jrpcgen</code> contains an example of
how to use the <code>jrpcgen</code> rpc protocol compiler. To generate
source code from the x-file, run:
<pre>
java -jar jrpcgen.jar -p tests.org.acplt.oncrpc.jrpcgen -nobackup demo.x
</pre>
</ul>

<p><li><code>classes/</code>: compiled Java bytecode. After running
the <code>jarify.bat</code> script, this directory will also contain
two jar files called <code>classes/oncrpc.jar</code> and
<code>classes/jrpcgen.jar</code>.

<p><li><code>projects/</code>: contains project files for Borland's JBuilder.

<p><li><code>readme-first/</code>: this directory containing release
and changelog information about one or several modules or Java packages.

<p><li><code>etc/</code>: misc. stuff (scripts) for maintaining the
Remote Tea ONC/RPC Java Library. Currently, this is rather Win32-centric, but
this will change in the future (writing the same scripts for unices
should be really straightforward).

<ul>
<li><code>docify.cmd</code> runs javadoc on all <code>org.acplt.*</code>
packages, thus making live much easier (or do you want to type such
long command lines over and over again?).

<li><code>phpify.pl</code> is probably not useful for anyone except
me: it copies the javadoc-generated html files over to another directory
and modifies the html code by inserting php commands and removing
unnecessary html code. The generated pages then can be used for
the web server of the Chair of Process Control Engineering.

<li><code>build.bat</code> runs <code>javac</code> on all source code
(including examples). In case of Sun's <code>javac</code> the term "runs"
is much too euphemistically -- "crawls" would be more precise. Afterwards,
the packages belonging to <code>org.acplt.oncrpc</code> (including sub
packages) will be archived into the file called
<code>classes/oncrpc.jar</code>.

<li><code>jarify.bat</code> archives the packages belonging to <code>org.acplt.oncrpc</code>
(including sub packages) into the file called
<code>classes/oncrpc.jar</code>.
</ul>

</ul>

<p>So far, the Remote Tea ONC/RPC Java package is developed and tested using
Borland's JBuilder&nbsp;3 featuring Sun's JDK-1.2.2-001 (Windows) as well
as JBuilder&nbsp;6 with JDK-1.3.1. In addition
I also use en par JBuilder&nbsp;4 with IBM's JDK-1.3.0 on Linux. I would like
to hear feedback from people using other Java2-compliant Java compilers and
virtual machines. For people who want to compile the source themselves, there
is a JBuilder project file called <code>remotetea.jpr</code> in the
<code>projects/</code> directory. The project file just compiles all
packages but does nothing else.
