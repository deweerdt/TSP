If you want to produce a JUnit test report for TSP, 
you can run TSP JUnit test with the command :
   ant test-report   
but to do this, you need to
- 1) copy junit.jar into this directory
- 2) copy junit.jar into the lib directory of your ant installation (or add
junit.jar to your global CLASSPATH)

You can get junit.jar at : http://www.junit.org
