TSP : library for a generic Transfer Sampling Protocol

This project is in early development but should be functional.

Is provided : 
- the TSP consumer library (i.e. : for clients)
- the TSP provider library (i.e. : for servers)
- Some test programs

Whenever you need to read from a server a bunch of evolving variables,
at high rate thrue a network, TSP is for you.

Using the TSP producer and consumer API, you may write :

* A TSP consumer, ex :
- GUI that plots the data
- a data analyser
- a data recoder
- ...

that connects to a

* A TSP provider, ex :
- Any program that have a source of named variables.

Using the API, the TSP consumer may ask the provider the list
of available variables, choose some variables, and begin
receiving the evolving values.

TSP is designed to be CPU and bandwith friendly (both for the producer
and the consumer)
